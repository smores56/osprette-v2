The Osprette V2
===============

The Osprette V2 is a 34-key unsplit keyboard. It has the following features:

- Choc V1 switches
- Optionally hotswap using Kailh choc hotswap sockets
- Bluetooth-capable with a nice!nano controller
- Pinky clusters (top pinky keys on the sides)
- Splay (4° between middle and ring, 8° between ring and pinky)

## How to Order

The [gerber folder](./gerber) has everything you'll need to get this printed.
You'll want to print one of each of the 4 gerber ZIP's where the switch plates
and the bottom plate are 1.2mm thick and the main PCB is 1.6mm thick. You can
order from [JLC](https://jlcpcb.com) by just uploading each archive and keeping
the default options asides from the thickness. I'd suggest removing the order number,
otherwise they'll put one on the board somewhere randomly.
